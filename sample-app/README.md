# Sample HTTPS Application for Istio Mesh

A minimal Python Flask HTTPS application designed for Sail Operator-managed Istio mesh in a compliance-oriented Kubernetes setup.

## Features

- **HTTPS Service**: Flask app with self-signed TLS certificates on port 443
- **Compliance Ready**: Security headers, non-root user, resource limits
- **Istio Compatible**: Works with Sail Operator and ambient mesh
- **Health Checks**: `/health`, `/ready`, and `/metrics` endpoints
- **Auto-Routing**: Compatible with `enterprise-sim.sh routes reconcile`

## Quick Deploy

### Deploy with `kubectl` + Kustomize (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. (optional) Review intent in sample-app/.env.template
# Edit ONLY ENVIRONMENT or APP_DOMAIN in .env.template (everything else is auto-generated)

# (Do not edit sample-app/.env directly â€” it will be re-generated)

# 2. Apply the full stack with kubectl's built-in Kustomize support
kubectl apply -k sample-app

# 3. (Optional) Trigger the enterprise routing reconciler if using auto-hosts
./enterprise-sim.sh routes reconcile
```

The app will be available at: `https://<region>-<route_host>.<ingress_domain>` using the values from `.env` (defaults to `https://us-hello.localhost`).

> `kubectl apply -k sample-app` creates a `sample-app-env` ConfigMap sourced from `.env`, so any change to that file will flow into both the pod environment variables and the Istio routing templates on the next apply.

### Preview or customize the manifests

```bash
# Diff the rendered resources before applying
kubectl kustomize sample-app | less

# Update a single value (e.g., switch namespace) then re-apply
# (edit only sample-app/.env.template, not .env)
kubectl apply -k sample-app

# Clean up
kubectl delete -k sample-app
```

## Application Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main application endpoint with request info
- `GET /health` - Health check for liveness probes
- `GET /ready` - Readiness check for readiness probes
- `GET /metrics` - Basic metrics endpoint

## Security Features

- **Non-root container**: Runs as user 1000
- **Security contexts**: Pod and container level restrictions
- **Resource limits**: Memory and CPU constraints
- **HTTPS only**: Self-signed TLS certificates
- **Security headers**: HSTS, CSP, XSS protection
- **Istio mTLS**: Service-to-service encryption

## Istio Configuration

- **VirtualService**: Routes external HTTPS traffic through mesh gateway
- **DestinationRule**: Enforces mTLS and load balancing policies
- **Compliance labels**: `compliance.routing/enabled=true` for auto-routing

## Environment Variables

| Variable     | Default      | Description                                 |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `ENVIRONMENT`| `dev`       | Intention, controls all derived config      |
| (others)     | *(derived)* | All others computed by orchestration script |

## Testing

```bash
# Test health endpoint
kubectl exec -it deployment/$APP_NAME -- curl -k https://localhost:443/health

# Test external access (after gateway setup)
curl -k https://$REGION-$ROUTE_HOST.$K3S_INGRESS_DOMAIN/

# Check Istio configuration
kubectl get virtualservice,destinationrule -n $NAMESPACE
```

## Compliance Notes

- Uses `compliance.routing/*` labels for enterprise-sim integration
- Follows security best practices for containers
- Compatible with PeerAuthentication STRICT mTLS policies
- Includes monitoring and observability endpoints
